Analysis on expected credit score based on income, profession and other data

Problem statement: Our company has collected basic bank details and gathered a lot of credit-related information. At the moment this requires a lot of manual effort, and management wants to build an intelligent system to segregate the people into credit score brackets. Given a personâ€™s credit-related information, we aim to build a machine learning model that can classify the credit score.
